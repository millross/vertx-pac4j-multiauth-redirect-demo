= vertx-pac4j-multiauth-redirect-demo

A small demo project to show how to use multi authorizations in vertx-pac4j, preventing the user from logging in multiple times via different mechanisms

To run the project, first issue the command

mvn clean package

at the command line, and then

java -jar target/vertx-pac4j-multiauth-demo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar

Note that the resources to hit are

http://localhost:8080/protected/index.html<br>
http://localhost:8080/protected/test.html<br>
http://localhost:8080/login<br>

At the moment it's possible to hit http://localhost:8080/login even when already logged in - this is a bug
in the sample. The intent is that hitting the login url when already logged in will just redirect to
http://localhost:8080/protected/index.html - the default landing page following login (although it will be possible
to hit any protected resource directly when already logged in, or if not logged in, a login process will be triggered)
